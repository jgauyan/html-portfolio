<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jon and I am an aspiring web developer. 
  I am brand new to all of this (coding and web development). 
  I have a profound knowledge of computers and like to consider myself tech savy.
  My hobbies include pickleball, cooking, weightlifting, being active as much as I can, and spending time with family and friends. 
  Disney and Anime are my guilty pleasures. 
  I live in San Diego, CA and I am born and raised here. 
  I like to consider myself one of the easiest & coachable people and I learn pretty quickly. 
  This has been a fun journey learning about coding and web development. 
  Let's see where this path takes me!
